## Intellectual property

IP is often bucketed into pre-competitive and competitive IP (add this ref) , with post-competitive being a less established term we will define in this guidance. In clinical reporting, we place significant resources into the collection and presentation of information that was collected on our competitive IP in confirmatory clinical trials. In order to help separate this simpler case from pre-competitive â€“ here we define as post-competitive a unique scenario of code that takes data generated as part of confirmatory studies (e.g. a Phase III trial) and creates an output. Post-competitive IP is where the benefits of open sourcing and encouraging between company collaboration can be more clearly differentiated from potential competitive advantage in developing new medicines. 

The following summarises the three types of IP: 

1. **Pre-competitive**: IP which is not a competitive advantage. This can be a complex definition, and will require guidance from company council. For instance, data standards may clearly be pre-competitive, but for anonymised data from historical trials, or an algorithm that generates risk scores for a certain outcome could provide a competitive advantage, or be defined as pre-competitive. 
1. **Competitive IP**: Clinical reporting relevant examples would be information on a new target, molecule or algorithm that provides an advantage in the creation of new medicines, or as a standalone data product that can be monetized.  
1. **Post-competitive IP**: Code that translates existing eCRF data into a CSR for submission.
